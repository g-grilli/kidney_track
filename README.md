<h1>Kidney Track</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>The first year after a kidney transplant requires a lot of monitoring, 
changes  and tracking.  Currently the transplant recipient leaves the hospital 
with a 3 inch ring binder which contains information on items such as medications, dosages, 
when to take them, and a schedule of doctor visits. A separate  section to track 
your daily weight weight and blood pressure reading.  A section on what to do if. 
A section on diet. Even a handy dandy section for a business card collection.  
This book needs to be hauled around to various checkups and tests, but the information 
quickly changes as medications are added, dosages changed or just stopped altogether, 
clinic appointments and tests are added,  for for the pack rat at heart this creates 
a daunting challenge and administrative PIB.</p>

burden for the transplant family.<p>
