<h1>Kidney Track</h1>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>The first year after a kidney transplant requires a lot of monitoring, 
changes  and tracking.</p><p>Currently the transplant recipient leaves the hospital 
with a 3 inch ring binder which contains information on items such as medications, dosages, 
when to take them, and a schedule of doctor visits. A separate  section to track 
your daily weight weight and blood pressure reading.  A section on what to do if. 
A section on diet. Even a handy dandy section for a business card collection.  
</p><p>This book needs to be hauled around to various checkups and tests, but the information 
quickly changes as medications are added, dosages changed or just stopped altogether, 
clinic appointments and tests are added,  for the pack rat at heart this creates 
a daunting challenge and administrative PIB.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3> 
<p><strong>Kidney Track</strong> is a single page progressive web app that help's ease the administrative 
burden for the transplant family.<p>
<p><strong>Kidney Track</strong> takes advantage of the Firebase API to store user data which makes the information 
available on any web connected device the user selects.<p>
